Introducing Discourde, the new way to connect with the world. 

It's like Discord, with stero√Øds.

## Startup and installation

First, we clone the project.

```
  git clone https://github.com/EndeurNight/Discourde.git
```

Since we like risk, we go to the dangerous Discourde folder

```
  cd Discourde
```

Then, we call on the great god pip to install all the nice dependencies: 

```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, we run ``main.py`` and pray that it works.

```
  python main.py
```
