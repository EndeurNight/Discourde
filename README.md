## About Discourde

Imagine a place where communication is effortless, seamless, and instantaneous. A place where words flow freely and ideas are shared with ease. A place where the barriers of distance and time are broken down, and the world becomes one global community.

Introducing Discourde, the new way to connect with the world. 

It's like Discord, with stero√Øds.

## Startup and installation

First, we clone the project.

```
  git clone https://github.com/EndeurNight/Discourde.git
```

Since we like risk, we go to the dangerous Discourde folder

```
  cd Discourde
```

Then, we call on the great god pip to install all the nice dependencies: 

```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, we run ``main.py`` and pray that it works.

```
  python main.py
```
